# AcademyBugs - Manual Testing

## 📌 Project Overview
AcademyBugs is a **manual testing project** aimed at identifying and documenting defects within an educational platform. This repository contains detailed bug reports and test cases to ensure the system's reliability and usability.

The testing process follows industry best practices to uncover **functional, UI/UX, and performance issues**. Key testing techniques used:

- **Exploratory Testing**: Uncovering unexpected behaviors without predefined scripts.
- **Equivalence Partitioning (EP)**: Validating different input conditions.
- **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**: Checking system responses at edge limits.
- **Positive & Negative Testing**: Ensuring correct and incorrect inputs are handled properly.
